  <p>Chem-E-Car is an annual competition for students majoring in Chemical Engineering and its related disciplines. It is conducted by AIChE (American Institute of Chemical Engineers). It engages college students in designing and constructing a car powered by a chemical energy source that will safely carry over a specific load over a given distance and stop. It is a project through which collaborative efforts are made from all branches of engineering. While creation of these cars is fun, the competition is entertaining and is a valuable recruiting and retention tool. The contest clearly reveals issues of process safety, reliability, economics, teamwork and environment care that chemical engineers face in industry everyday . In particular some of the mechanical and electrical problems that continue to be encountered can be solved almost immediately by any Mechanical or Electrical Major. Similarly any queries with regard to usage of materials can be cleared by a Material Sciences Engineer. The competition looks forward to take in the ideas of the students in multiple disciplines and implement them in a collaborative manner so as to create a car which is efficient and environment-friendly.</p>
<br></div>
    <br><br>

<div class="b"><h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>To provide chemical engineering students with the opportunity to participate in a team- oriented hands-on design and construction of a small chemical powered model car </li>
	<li>To demonstrate the ability to safely control a chemical reaction by changing a chemical reactant </li>
	<li>To encourage students to become actively involved in their professional society </li>
	<li>To increase awareness of the chemical engineering discipline among the general public, industry leaders, educators and other students</li>
</ul><br/>
<p>There is a poster session, safety inspection and a performance session at each competition. During the competition, each team will be asked to introduce its entry to the audience and jury, giving the school name and briefly discussing the propulsion and stopping mechanisms.</p>

    <h2>Safety Rules : </h2><br><img src="104.jpg" hspace="10" align="right" alt="image_104">
   <ul>
    <li> An engineering documentation package(EDP) for your ChemECar must be completed and submitted within the deadline. In the EDP, it is important to have photos of your Car and citation of Job Safety analysis, hazard analysis, chemical safety information, standard/safe operating conditions, etc. </li>
    <li> On the day of the competition, an audit team will inspect each vehicle to ensure that all of the safety requirements have been met and that the vehicle will operate without risk to the operators, contest staff and spectators. If the safety audit team deems the vehicle safe to operate, then the vehicle will be given permission to compete, and otherwise, not. </li>
    <li> Uses of certain chemicals such as compressed hydrogen gas cylinder are prohibited . Illegal disposal of chemicals will disqualify the team from the competition. </li>
    <li> The car should not produce flame, smoke, noise, liquid, vapour, odour discharge, etc. All containers involved in the reaction setup should be closed or properly secured. </li>
    <li> Usage of highly reactive/unstable chemicals will not be permitted. </li>
    <li> All components, including vessels, piping and fittings, valves, gauges, filters, must be certified to operate at a pressure greater than your vehicle’s maximum operating pressure (MOP). </li>
    <li> Temperature, Electrical and Mechanical hazards must be taken into consideration and enough precautions must be taken for the same. </li>
    <li> Each team must provide the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) for use in the chemical prep area, as identified in their JSA, and must use them properly. This includes lab coats, safety glasses, gloves, face shields, and hearing protection. The personal protective equipment must be used appropriately by all team members depending on the hazards encountered during the chemical preparation. </li>
    <li> All containers with chemicals, including bottles, beakers, syringes and plastic bags must be properly labelled. </li>
    <li> For battery-operated cars, any requests to charge batteries overnight or longer than three hours before the competition starts will not be granted. </li>
</ul>
